Loop of Destiny Game

How it works:
The game runs a loop where each iteration represents a turn. The loop continues until the player wins, loses, or runs out of turns.

End Conditions:
Win → Score reaches 100
Lose → Lives reach 0 or Energy reaches 0
Timeout → Turns reach 0

Choices:
Attack → gain score, lose energy, risk damage
Rest → regain energy
Focus → small score gain, small energy cost

Concepts Used:
Loops, conditionals, state variables, break, continue, user input.
